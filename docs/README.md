## ðŸ’» Usage

Start by including the library header file:

```cpp
#include "Arduino_LowPowerPortentaH7.h"
```

What you do next depends on what you want to achieve. Using only one of Deep Sleep Mode and Standby Mode might be sufficient, or you might want to combine them. If you combine them, start by enabling Deep Sleep Mode, perform any necessary work, and let the board go into Standby Mode until you need to perform more work.

### Deep Sleep Mode

The only function necessary to enable automatic Deep Sleep Mode is `allowDeepSleep()`. You might also find the following functions helpful: `canDeepSleep()`, `timeSinceBoot()`, `timeSpentIdle()`, `timeSpentInSleep()`, and `timeSpentInDeepSleep()`. Another function that can be useful when debugging Deep Sleep Locks, but not for production code, is `numberOfDeepSleepLocks()`.

> [!CAUTION]
> The `numberOfDeepSleepLocks()` function should never be used in production code because it relies on undocumented functionality in Mbed.

### Standby Mode

To use Standby Mode, you need the following functions: `checkOptionBytes()`, `prepareOptionBytes()`, `standbyM7()`, and `standbyM4()`. The option byte functions are necessary to ensure that the flash option bytes in the microcontroller are correctly set for going into Standby Mode. 
Additionally, you can use `wasInCPUMode()` to check what the board was doing before it started:
By passing one of the modes `d1DomainStandby`, `d2DomainStandby`, `standby` or `stop` as parameter you can determine in which of these modes the CPU was before it started. It's possible that the CPU was in more than one of these modes so you need to check for each mode separately to get the complete picture.
Only if `wasInCPUMode(CPUMode::standby)` returns true, Standby Mode was entered correctly. The other functions can be handy for troubleshooting. Remember to clear the mode flags by calling `resetPreviousCPUModeFlags()` when you are done checking them.

The microcontroller has three power domains: one for the M7 core (D1), one for the M4 core (D2), and a separate third domain (D3) for some other functionality. `wasInCPUMode(CPUMode::d1DomainStandby)` returns true if D1 was in standby, but all three weren't at the same time, while `wasInCPUMode(CPUMode::d2DomainStandby)()` returns true if D2 was in standby, but all three weren't at the same time. Both functions can return true simultaneously if D1 and D2 were in standby mode while D3 was still awake. When all three domains are in standby mode simultaneously, the microcontroller as a whole enters Standby Mode automatically, and `wasInCPUMode(CPUMode::standby)` returns true when it wakes up again. The `wasInCPUMode(CPUMode::stop)` function should never return true but can be helpful for further troubleshooting if you encounter any issues with this library.

All configuration of Standby Mode is done when calling `standbyM7()`. It takes one or two parameters, depending on the conditions you want to set for waking up. The first parameter is one of the flags `LowPowerStandbyType::untilPinActivity` and `LowPowerStandbyType::untilTimeElapsed`. If you want to wake up from either type of event, you can combine the flags like so: `LowPowerStandbyType::untilPinActivity | LowPowerStandbyType::untilTimeElapsed`. If `LowPowerStandbyType::untilTimeElapsed` is present, the function takes a second parameter. This parameter's preferred format is `2_h + 30_min + 45_s`. You can use any combination of hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, `15_h`, or `1_h + 30_min`, or just `90_s`. If you first have to calculate the delay in your sketch, you can also pass something like this: `RTCWakeupDelay(1, 20, 30)`. The first number is hours, the second minutes, and the third seconds. But, the preferred option is to use _h, _min, and _s since that's more explicit.

When the microcontroller wakes up again from Standby Mode, both the M7 and the M4 cores do so in parallel.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must always upload a sketch to the M4 core, in which you call `standbyM4()`, even if you don't intend to use the M4 core. If you don't, the microcontroller won't enter Standby Mode as a whole, even if you call `standbyM7()`, and that will lead to an increased power consumption.
